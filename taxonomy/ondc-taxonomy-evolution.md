# Evolution of ONDC Taxonomy: From Original Structure to Multi-Taxonomy Framework

## 1. Original ONDC Taxonomy: Key Challenges

The original ONDC taxonomy structure faced several critical challenges that limited effective product discovery and created difficulties for both sellers and buyer applications:

### Discovery Limitations
- **Rigid Hierarchical Navigation**: Forced linear navigation paths that didn't match diverse shopping behaviors
- **Limited Search Entry Points**: Difficult for users to find products without knowing exact category paths
- **Poor Cross-Category Discovery**: Products that fit multiple categories were hard to discover
- **Inconsistent Category Mapping**: Different sellers categorized similar products differently

### Implementation Challenges
- **Complex Hierarchical Codes**: Deep category trees created unwieldy category codes
- **Attribute Consistency Issues**: Unclear which attributes were required vs. optional
- **Limited Standardization**: Inadequate guidance on attribute values led to inconsistent implementations
- **Integration Complexity**: Sellers struggled to map their existing taxonomies to ONDC structure

### User Experience Problems
- **Browsing Friction**: Category structures often didn't match how users naturally think about products
- **Search Relevance Issues**: Difficult to return relevant results across category boundaries
- **Limited Personalization**: One-size-fits-all approach didn't address different user shopping patterns
- **Category Discoverability**: Users had difficulty finding the right categories for their needs

## 2. ONDC Taxonomy 2.0: Key Improvements

The ONDC Taxonomy 2.0 (as shown in the Excel document) addressed many of these challenges through a more structured, standardized approach:

### Improved Categorization Structure
- **Streamlined RET12-XXX Code System**: More compact, standardized category coding system
- **Category Grouping**: Better organization of related product types
- **Clearer Hierarchy**: Simplified domain → subdomain → category structure

### Enhanced Attribute Framework
- **Attribute Classification System**: Clear MC/MI/OI (Mandatory Core, Mandatory Item-specific, Optional Item-specific) structure
- **Suggestive Enumerations**: Standardized value lists for key attributes
- **Comprehensive Attribute Coverage**: Expanded attribute set with product-specific characteristics

### Better Discovery Support
- **Keyword Mapping System**: Dedicated structure for mapping keywords to categories
- **More Specific Categories**: 198+ detailed product categories for finer-grained organization
- **Improved Cross-Referencing**: Better support for related category discovery

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Enhanced Compliance Fields**: Structured fields for all legal requirements
- **Better Implementation Guidance**: Clear indicators of which attributes are required

## 3. Multi-Taxonomy Framework: Building on 2.0 for Enhanced Discovery

While Taxonomy 2.0 improves standardization and structure, the Multi-Taxonomy Framework takes discovery to the next level with minimal additional integration work:

### Key Benefits for Buyer Apps

1. **Multiple Product Discovery Paths**
   - Enables browsing products by different facets (product type, gender, occasion, etc.)
   - Accommodates diverse user shopping behaviors in a single implementation
   - Creates multiple entry points for product discovery

2. **Simplified Search Implementation**
   - Pre-built category mappings eliminate complex search logic
   - Cross-category search works automatically through taxonomy mappings
   - Tags-based searching becomes more powerful with multiple taxonomy perspectives

3. **Enhanced Personalization Opportunities**
   - Can present different taxonomies based on user preferences or behavior
   - Enables A/B testing different navigation approaches
   - Allows progressive adaptation to user shopping patterns

4. **Implementation Efficiency**
   - Uses existing ONDC structures without requiring protocol changes
   - Backward compatible with all buyer apps
   - Requires minimal additional code for significant discovery improvements

### Technical Implementation Advantages

1. **Catalog Flexibility with ONDC Compliance**
   - Maintains full compliance with ONDC standards
   - Primary RET12 taxonomy serves as canonical reference
   - Alternative taxonomies provide enhanced discovery without breaking the standard

2. **Enhanced Attribute Utilization**
   - Taxonomy 2.0's rich attribute structure powers multiple classification views
   - Better utilization of existing attribute data
   - More opportunities to leverage product characteristics for discovery

3. **Improved Cross-Selling Opportunities**
   - Reveals relationships between products across traditional category boundaries
   - Creates opportunities for intelligent recommendations
   - Enables more intuitive product exploration

### Built for Future Evolution

1. **Scalable Framework**
   - Can accommodate new taxonomies as market needs evolve
   - Works with both simple and complex product catalogs
   - Supports future ONDC protocol enhancements

2. **Data-Driven Optimization**
   - Enables tracking which taxonomies drive better engagement
   - Supports continuous improvement based on user behavior
   - Allows incremental refinement of taxonomies

3. **Simplified Onboarding for New Participants**
   - Easier catalog integration for new sellers
   - More intuitive discovery for new buyers
   - Reduces technical barriers to entry

## 4. Implementation Requirements for Buyer Apps

To leverage the Multi-Taxonomy Framework, buyer apps need minimal changes:

1. **Recognition of Multiple Taxonomy Structures**
   - Parse the `bpp/categories` array for multiple taxonomy definitions
   - Display appropriate taxonomy selector in the UI

2. **Cross-Reference Utilization**
   - Use mapping tags to maintain context when switching between taxonomies
   - Leverage product-level taxonomy references for enhanced search

3. **UI Considerations**
   - Provide intuitive UI for switching between taxonomy views
   - Consider defaulting to different taxonomies based on context or user history

4. **Search Enhancements**
   - Index products across all taxonomies for better search relevance
   - Use taxonomy relationships to expand search results intelligently

### Potential Migration Considerations

For organizations considering adopting the Multi-Taxonomy approach, these factors should be evaluated:

- **Implementation Phasing**: Multi-Taxonomy can be implemented incrementally, starting with a few key alternative taxonomies before expanding
- **Pilot Opportunities**: Initial implementation could target specific product categories where alternative navigation would most benefit users
- **Technical Assessment**: Evaluate current catalog management systems for their ability to maintain multiple taxonomy relationships
- **Training Requirements**: Product catalog teams may need training on how to properly map products across multiple taxonomies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement analytics to measure how alternative taxonomies affect product discovery and conversion

The Multi-Taxonomy approach represents a forward-looking enhancement that builds upon Taxonomy 2.0's foundation. By focusing on low-effort implementation while maximizing discovery benefits, it provides a practical path forward for the ONDC ecosystem.

## 7. Conclusion

The evolution from the original ONDC taxonomy to the Multi-Taxonomy Framework represents a significant advancement in product discovery capability with minimal additional implementation burden.

While Taxonomy 2.0 addresses many standardization and structural issues of the original taxonomy, the Multi-Taxonomy Framework builds on this foundation to dramatically improve product discovery by accommodating diverse shopping behaviors and creating multiple paths to product discovery.

For buyer apps, the multi-taxonomy approach enables better search with limited intervention by leveraging pre-built category relationships and providing multiple navigation paradigms that can be easily presented to users based on context or preference.

This approach maintains full ONDC compliance while unlocking the full potential of the rich product information contained in the catalog, creating a more effective discovery experience for all ONDC participants.
